# Task 6
### Iris Flower Species Dataset

In this tutorial we will use the Iris Flower Species Dataset.

The Iris Flower Dataset involves predicting the flower species given measurements of iris flowers.

It is a multiclass classification problem. The number of observations for each class is balanced. There are 150 observations with 4 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows  :

        Sepal length in cm.
        Sepal width in cm.
        Petal length in cm.
        Petal width in cm.
        Class
## Prediction using Decision Tree
	â€¢In this task we will use decision tree to make prediction and understand its working.!

# Decision Tree

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes).

The dataset here has 6 different parameters , so we can use decision tree to feed any new/test data to this classifer and it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.



### STEPS INVOLVED IN TRAINING THE MODEL :
    Step 1 : import all the required libraries required .

    Step 2 : Read the dataset.

    Step 3 : Define X and y .

    Step 4 :  lets train our model and fit the dataset.

    Step 6 : Now check the accuracy of the model and evaluate it

    Step 7 : Now lets you test how well your model fits the data set.

    Step 8 : Finally get a full summary of your model using a tree.
