# LINEAR REGRESSION

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.
There are two types of supervised machine learning algorithms: Regression and classification. The former predicts continuous value outputs while the latter predicts discrete outputs


The term “linearity” in algebra refers to a linear relationship between two or more variables. If we draw this relationship in a two-dimensional space (between two variables), we get a straight line.
Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.
 
If we plot the independent variable (x) on the x-axis and dependent variable (y) on the y-axis, linear regression gives us a straight line that best fits the data points, as shown in the figure below.
We know that the equation of a straight line is basically:

### The equation of the line is :

### Y= mx + b :

The dataset here has 34 different parameters , so we can’t use simple linear regression, So we choose to apply multiple Multiple Linear Regression.

### STEPS INVOLVED IN TRAINING THE MODEL :
    Step 1 : import all the required libraries required .

    Step 2 : Read the dataset.

    Step 3 : Define X and y .

    Step 4 : Use train test split from sklearn.

    Step 5 : lets train our model and fit the dataset.

    Step 6 : Now check the accuracy of the model.

    Step 7 : Now lets you test how well your model fits the data set.

    Step 8 : Finally get a full summary of your model.
