    Also as a business manager to increase your profits we could try to improve the outlets where the sales and profits are far less as compared to cities like New York City and Los Angeles.
    We could also use the fact that costumers in cities like New York City and Los Angeles or states like California and New York like our products more.
    Using the above fact we increase our profits in such cities and states.
